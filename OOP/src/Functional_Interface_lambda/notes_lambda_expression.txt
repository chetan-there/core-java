What is lambda Expression in java ?

it is a new feature introduces in java jdk 1.8 onwards.

it is an anonymous function i.e function without any name 

in java it is used to enable functional programing

it is used to concise our code as well as can remove boilerplate code

lambda will work only with Functional Interface

if the body of lambda Expressionn contains only one statement then curly braces are optional

we can also remove the variables type while defining the lambda expression parameter

if the lambda expression method contains only one parameter then we can remove () symbol also.
 
In lambda expression return keyword is optional but if we use return keyword then {} are 
compulsory. 
 
Independently Lamda Expression is not a statement. 
 
It requires a target variable i.e functional interface reference only. 
 
Lamda target can't be class or abstract class, it will work with functional interface only.

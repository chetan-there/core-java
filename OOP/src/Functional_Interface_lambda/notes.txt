introduction to Functional Programming ?  
From JDK 8 onwards, Java also concentrated on function/method and introduced Functional 
Programming. 
 
It is mainly used to write concise coding so the length of the method will be reduced. 
 
What is a Functional interface in java ?  
If an interface contains exactly one abstract method then  
that interface is known as Functional interafce. 
 
Example :  
public interface Drawable 
{ 
  void draw();  //SAM [Single abstract method] 
} 
 
 
It may contain 'n' number of default and static methods but It must contain only one abstract 
method. 
 
In order to restrict developer to take more than one abstract method, Java software people has 
introduced @FunctionalInterface annotation. 
 
Example : 
@FunctionalInterface 
interface Vehicle 
{ 
 void run();  
}  
package com.ravi.default_method; 
 
@FunctionalInterface 
interface Vehicle 
{ 
 void run();  
} 
public class MultipleInheritance  
{ 
 public static void main(String[] args)  
 { 
  Vehicle car = new Vehicle()  
  {   
   @Override 
   public void run()  
   { 
    System.out.println("Car is Running");     
   } 
  }; 
   
  Vehicle bike = new Vehicle()  
  {   
   @Override 
   public void run()  
   { 
    System.out.println("Bike is Running");     
   } 
  }; 
   
  car.run();  bike.run(); 
 } 
 
}
